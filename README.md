# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Media_Search
Medical Search web application built using React and Redux Toolkit. This is my first project implementing Redux Toolkit for state management, focused on searching and displaying medical-related data efficiently.
This project is a Medical Search web application developed using React. The main goal of the project was to learn and implement Redux Toolkit for global state management.

Users can search for medical-related information, and the application efficiently manages search queries, results, and UI state using Redux Toolkit. This project helped me understand core Redux concepts like slices, reducers, actions, and store configuration in a real-world use case.

Tech Stack

React.js
Redux Toolkit
JavaScript
CSS / Tailwind

Key Learnings

Setting up Redux Toolkit store
Creating slices and reducers
Managing global state in React
Connecting Redux with React components

This is my first hands-on project using Redux Toolkit, built to strengthen my understanding of scalable state management in React applications.
