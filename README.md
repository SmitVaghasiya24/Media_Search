## 📌 Project Overview

Media Search is a medical search web application built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**.  
This is my **first project implementing Redux Toolkit** for global state management, focused on searching and displaying medical-related data efficiently.

Users can search for medical-related information, and the application manages search queries, results, and UI state using Redux Toolkit.  
This project helped me understand core Redux concepts in a real-world use case.
